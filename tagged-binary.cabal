name:                tagged-binary
version:             0.2.0.1
synopsis:            Provides tools for serializing data tagged with type
                     information.
description:         Very minimal library providing tools for serializing and
                     decoding data into 'ByteString' tagged with information
                     about its type, inspired by Cloud Haskell and
                     distributed-process.
                     .
                     Intended for use by libraries and frameworks in
                     distributed contexts, such as distributed computation
                     between native servers and communication between native
                     servers and ghcjs/various front-ends, for behavior
                     similar to the polymorphic communication channels of
                     Cloud Haskell and distributed-process; servers can send
                     tagged data, and clients can choose to selectively
                     accept, ignore or queue incoming messages depending on
                     their types.
                     .
                     For basic encoding, decoding and categorization, only
                     'Data.Binary.Tagged' should be necessary.
                     'Data.Binary.Tagged.Internal' is exported in case you
                     need it.
                     .
                     Quick example:
                     .
                     > > let x = encodeTagged (1 :: Int)
                     > > decodeTagged x :: Maybe Bool
                     > Nothing
                     > > decodeTagged x :: Maybe Int
                     > Just 1
